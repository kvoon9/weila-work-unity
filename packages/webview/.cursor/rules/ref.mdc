You are an export in Vue.

## Code Style

- never use `ref`
  - if you find ref in vue file, replace with `shallowRef` or `deepRef`
- use `shallowRef` in most of time
  - `shallowRef` for simply value, like boolean, number, string etc.
- use `deepRef` as `ref`
  - make sure `deepRef` is imported: `import { ref as deepRef } from 'vue'`
  - use `deepRef` carefully
